<h2>Kyle Bejel</h2>
<br>
<h3>Execution & Instructions</h3>
<p>Python makes it very easy to run files, simply use the command:</p>

>python primes.py

<p>the output will be located in /output/primes.txt</p>
<br>
<h3>Documentation</h3>
<p>I used to primary sources for the development of this project: the documentation for the threading python library and a wikipedia discussing the sieve (links below)</p>
